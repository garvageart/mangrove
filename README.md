# Mangrove

Mangrove is a program designed to manage and sync data between Webflow and the local database

## Note
Before I write this readme with extensive information on how to set up Mangrove on your own, I must get all the setup right to make this portable and easy enough to use elsewhere except in my own system.

Until then, enjoy reading the source code <3
