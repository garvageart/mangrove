Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven
W. B. Yeats - 1865-1939

Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

Enjoy Your Life
Song by Romy Madley Croft

My mother says to me, "Enjoy your life"
My mother says to me
My mother says to me, "Enjoy your life"
My mother says to me
Somebody tell me why
I'm scared to close my eyes
And I'm too afraid to watch the news
Dancing on my own again
Anxiety, my old friend
Since when will you try something new?
I made a promise to my mother
To stop running from my problems
Oh, how she said to me, "Enjoy your life" (my mother says to me)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (my mother says to me)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (my mother says to me)
Somebody tell me why
I'm scared for you to see me cry
I feel fine, how about you?
I don't remember what my dreams are
I can hear her say, "Wake up"
Oh, how she said to me, "Enjoy your life" (my mother says to me)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (my mother says to me)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (my mother says to me)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (my mother says to me)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
Enjoy your life (enjoy your life)
My mother says to me, "Enjoy your life"
